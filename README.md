# üöÄ React.js Kanban Todo List Application
This project is a robust Kanban-style Todo List Application built with React.js and Next.js. It provides a comprehensive interface for managing tasks across New, Ongoing, and Done stages, focusing on a smooth user experience, modern React practices, and a responsive design.

This project was bootstrapped with create-next-app.

## ‚ú® Key Features
Kanban Board Structure: Organizes tasks into three distinct columns (New, Ongoing, Done) for clear visual task progression.

Responsive Design: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for a fully responsive layout, ensuring optimal viewing and usability across all device sizes.

### Task Management (CRUD):

Creation: Add new tasks to the New column via a dedicated modal, with validation for required fields.

Details & Editing: View and update task details (title, description, status) through a TaskDetailsModal. Tasks moved to Ongoing automatically prompt for a due date/time.

Deletion: Remove tasks using an option in their context menu.

### Intuitive Task Movement:

Drag-and-Drop (DnD): Seamlessly move tasks between columns using custom useDrag and useDrop hooks. Tasks dropped into a new column update status and are appended to the bottom.
<!-- 
Right-Click Context Menu: Provides alternative options to move tasks, dynamically showing relevant target columns. -->

### Overdue Task Tracking:

Date/Time Selector: Set specific due dates and times for Ongoing tasks.

Prominent Alerts: Overdue tasks trigger a red border and "‚ö†Ô∏è Overdue!" text on the card, alongside a global, dismissible alert box at the top of the board listing all overdue tasks.

Data Persistence: Integrates with browser's local storage to save and load all task data across sessions.

# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
React.js: Core UI library.

Next.js: React framework for production-grade applications.

TypeScript: For type safety and improved code maintainability.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.

next/font: Optimizes and loads fonts (Geist) for performance.

# üí° Advanced React Features & Best Practices
This project showcases proficiency in modern React development:

Component-Based Architecture: Structured into modular, reusable components (Board, Column, Card, TaskDetailsModal, AddTaskForm, Navbar, OptionsListMenu).

State Management: Employs useState for local component state and React Context API (ModalContext) for global state management, minimizing prop drilling.

React Hooks:

useEffect: Manages side effects like local storage persistence, overdue task monitoring, and initial data loading.

useCallback & useMemo: Strategically used for memoization of functions and components, optimizing rendering performance, especially within the DnD system.

Custom Hooks (useDrag, useDrop, useDragDrop): Encapsulates complex drag-and-drop logic, enhancing reusability and testability.

Event Handling: Comprehensive implementation of onClick, onChange, onDragStart, and onDrop for interactive elements.

TypeScript: Ensures robust type safety across all components, props, and data structures.

Performance Optimization: Achieved through memoization and immutable state updates.

Accessibility (A11y): Incorporates appropriate ARIA attributes for enhanced usability with assistive technologies.

Modern React Features (Suspense Concept): Demonstrates the principles of Suspense for asynchronous data loading, providing a smoother user experience with loading fallbacks.

Code Quality: Adheres to clean code principles with a logical folder structure and consistent coding styles.

# üöÄ Getting Started
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## ‚è≥ Future Enhancements
Drag-and-Drop Refinements: Optimize HandleDrop to pass only taskId for cleaner event handling.

Performance Optimization: Investigate Virtualization/Windowing for large task lists and implement Lazy Loading/Code Splitting for larger application parts.

Overdue Alerts: Implement a "Toast" or "Notification Bar" system for overdue alerts and refine logic to prevent setting past deadlines.

Mobile Responsiveness: Conduct thorough testing on various mobile devices, address horizontal scrollbar issues, and consider "show more" functionality for long columns.

API Integration: Transition to a backend API (e.g., Firebase Firestore) for robust data persistence and multi-user capabilities.

Testing: Implement comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

Code Quality: Integrate ESLint and Prettier for automated code linting and formatting.

Keyboard Navigation: Enhance accessibility with full keyboard navigation support.
